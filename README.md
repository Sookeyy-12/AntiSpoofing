# <center>AntiSpoofing - Datacollection and Training</center>

<center>⭐ Hi there, if you find this repo useful, could you please consider starring it? Thanks! ⭐</center>

## Project Overview

The AntiSpoofing project aims to develop a system for detecting and preventing spoofing attacks.
This README provides an overview of the project, including its

<b>NOTE</b>: To run the project locally, follow the instructions in the [RunLocally.md](RunLocally.md) file.

## Purpose

The purpose of this AntiSpoofing project is to enhance the security of a system by detecting and preventing spoofing attacks. Spoofing attacks involve impersonating a legitimate user or device to gain unauthorized access or deceive the system. By implementing effective anti-spoofing measures, the project aims to mitigate the risks associated with such attacks.

In addition, the project also supports the use of custom data for training the anti-spoofing system. This allows users to incorporate their own data sets, specific to their application or environment, to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the system. <br>
The project provides guidelines and tools for preprocessing and integrating custom data into the training process.

## Features

The AntiSpoofing project offers the following features:

- <u>Data Collection</u>: The project provides tools and guidelines for collecting relevant data to train the anti-spoofing system. This includes capturing various types of spoofing attempts and genuine user interactions.

- <u>Training</u>: The project includes training modules that utilize the collected data to train YOLOv8. These models will be used for detecting and classifying spoofing attempts.

- <u>Evaluation</u>: The project provides evaluation metrics and techniques to assess the performance of the trained models. This helps in fine-tuning the system and improving its accuracy.

- <u>Integration</u>: The project aims to provide integration capabilities with existing systems or frameworks. This allows the anti-spoofing system to be seamlessly incorporated into different applications or platforms.
